[2023-07-05, 6:00:28 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: Tzevet asepha notes - July 5th
don’t be on your phone in front of kids!!
fill out the zman sports Google form (with names) + try to get to zman sports in time so you can get assigned to things in time
EGE!! We need to be singing at shira and help people learn the songs and singing can help with that - keep the tempos too
mifkad was confusing, if you’re running an anaf you need to be at mifkad on time and holding your anaf sign so kids know where to go + when do kesher meetings start and when (happening tomorrow)
Count your kids during mifkad and breakfast!
elections were sad - tzevet should have been sitting with their kids and actually engaged. Difference between being present and being on!
kids shouldn’t just be leaving the chadar during lunch, unless they’re overwhelmed. We need to know where kids are at all times! Go find your kids if you notice they’re gone. They don’t need to go to their tzrif during lunch
If you see kids not at programming, ask them where they’re going. Help out tzevet by making sure kids are where they need to be!
Kids shouldn’t be going straight to the picky eaters table! They need to try the meal first
If kids go to picky eaters table, make sure they come back to the table
Don’t let kids slam the chairs and benches during lunch shira
if you want to have high tea with Leya, you need to tell her so she knows and can arrange it.
Put in your tzevet kupa!!! You put in your amount, not percentage, and include your name! You can ask noga for your salary if you need(It’s in the bayit)
Kids can’t have iPod touches - any device that is wifi enabled is not allowed at camp
If kids have an iPod or mp3 player they should be left in the tzrif
If you see a kid with a device, either get them to put it away, or get their tzevet to tell them to
If kids have passports, they need to be brought to Noga/Leya/the bayit
Check the big calendar so you know what your jobs are this session (the calendar is in the mo, techni, and was sent to the group chat)
If you’re unsure about the tafkid, ask someone what to do
Madrichol toran as the person who did it the day before to find out when you should wake up
During hodaot, when 2 fingers are up we can continue making noise, when 3 fingers are up we stop making noise and listen (3 fingers go up at 2:20)
Keep the 7/11 clean!!! Clean up after yourself!
count your kids all the time!! Communicate with tzevet when counting kids so everyone knows what’s going on
Things are breaking at machaneh rapidly, if we see something if broken, TELL EZRA!
If you bring a kid to the mirp, you need to communicate that to your tzevet!
remind med kids to wait outside of the mirp! Don’t walk into the exam room until told to enter
If a kid wants to be seen by the medic, one tzevet member needs to accompany them
Make sure kids are drinking water!! Fill their cups and make sure they’re drinking
tell gal if your kids want to be in the Hebrew fluent ivrit group!! Tell gal ahead of time so she can prepare for the number of kids that will come
Shira off blocks are posted in the mizrach rosh
many headless rats around machaneh, if you see one, tell rat specialist zac about it
prep for your consent erev kvutzah tonight during zman chofshi after dinner!!
Make sure kids come for meds before 10pm tonight.
the 7/11 is officially open, take care of it. Make sure the sevvy door is as closed as possible. Clean rims of containers! We cannot feed kids food from the sevvy
milk crate in the machzan labelled “sicha Lila” with a bag for each tzevet, grab your bag tonight for your sicha
Make sure kids are wearing proper shoes around machaneh!
[2023-07-05, 10:32:39 PM] ~ Michelle Worland: This was left by the pool. It belongs to someone named Alex Dorphan.
[2023-07-05, 10:32:39 PM] ~ Michelle Worland: There is also a red binder type note pad thing as well by the pool

[2023-07-08, 7:16:53 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: Tzevet asepha - July 8
 Brian says hi
One tzevet member goes to madatz peula, the rest of us go to mo for tzevet peula on Jewish revenge
Tzevet laundry on Monday (kids aren’t doing it) (no laundry for uri). If we want to do it we must put it in the van by midnight tomorrow (Sunday) night. The laundry won’t be back before Tiyul. We will do more laundry after tiyul.
2 week kids don’t do laundry
The next order is on Monday. Put your orders in tomorrow (Sunday) night
Tell the mitbach a week ahead if you need things from them (and specify how many people and dietary restrictions)
Don’t go into the freezer and/or walk-in without permission
Keep the 7/11 clean!!
Nothing goes on the bottom shelf of the sevvy fridge
Part of the madrichol torans job is to wipe up the water at the bottom of the sevvy fridge
Collective responsibility
When walking to the point and twin make sure people are walking 2-3 in a row. It’s for safety!!
Kids can’t cross the street without tzevet there crossing them (specifically the tzevet that is responsible for them in that moment)
Jackson’s happy and grateful, however be more quiet when walking by shomrimot shetach at night
Be quiet when walking through lower machaneh (remind older kids too)
Tick checks during mifkad and at night (new tick check song?)
Make sure you’re doing your tafkidim during Shabbat or check in if you can’t
Kids shouldn’t be skipping chug alef and bet - make sure you’re kids are where they need to be
We’re not allowed to take pictures of/with kids on our phones
You’re still on during Rikkud - shetach toran if your kids want to hang in the tzrif
Don’t sleep in past 10 on saturdays. Get your kids up and go breakfast
If you have kids going in cars, don’t forget about them! Keep track of your kids and let drivers and merp know - communicate. You need to check with the medics to see if your kid can get driven (do this BEFORE we’re about to leave)
Send kids for meds so they don’t miss doses
WATER!!! Kids and tzevet need to be drinking water (5small cups per meal)
Keep for tzrifim clean!!
Don’t let kids pee on the steps of the pee tzrif
People who are on for shira need to help Ana with teaching the song
We need help tonight w/Kish for tomorrow
Encourage kids not to swear in lower machaneh
If you’re in riff raff and have specific needs for tiyul, let the Tiyul specialists know ahead of time (like now)

[2023-07-10, 6:09:15 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: July 10 tzevet asepha
 don’t leave your garbage and dishes in the mizrad Rosh - not ok
Look at the big calendar and write down the things that you’re doing/what day you’re doing it. Keep on top of your tafkidim!!!
Tzvatim need to tell their keshers (maz, Melavot, Noga) about kid issues!!! Communicate things to them - they need to know. You don’t need to wait for a kesher meeting to update your keshers - if it’s important, come find someone to talk to asap
If there is a disclosure/potential disclosure, FIND NOGA!!!
The techni office is not a dumping ground - pick up after yourself and keep it clean!!!
Stop going in the techni’s desks!!! Don’t take shit unless you ask
What happened to cleanup after yom meyuchad? Things should’ve been cleaned, not ok
Collective responsibility, clean up after ourselves
If you’re on a 9-9, you come back and are on at 9
What happened at mifkad??? Kids can’t come late to mifkad and neither can tzevet. Don’t be late to mifkad!
If you’re a peacock, it means you come and find Ezra! Don’t make him track you down, find him and get a job directly from Ezra. And do your task!!!
If you’re not signed up for a block, go somewhere! Choose a station and go to it
Tiyul starts tomorrow! Talk to your kids about tiyul! Let them know what Tiyul they’re on. If kids don’t want to go, talk with Noga, medics, and kesher. Communicate with keshers to figure out game plan
Make sure your kids have all the necessary equipment for tiyul. If you or a kid borrow from a tzevet member, it’s YOUR job to make sure those items get returned
Bonimot won’t be at ivrit today - Gal is running ivrit fluent group and will let you know what’s up
Take a chill pill when ordering from kupa. It’s too much too fast, we need money to last for the summer. Be thoughtful in your orders!
Tzevet needs to be with your kids!!! Count your kids, know where they are, and communicate to your tzevet where they are
Think about the things are say to madatz! They should not be hearing about tzevet drama/gossip/relationships/fesh. Not appropriate
Erica says hi and would love to meet everyone! They’ll be here till Saturday! Come say hi
[2023-07-10, 6:41:44 PM] Mira: Hey! I know that yesterday was super crazy but I just want to stress again how important it is not to put glitter in the sink! It’s super bad for both the plumbing and the environment. I had to spend most of the morning just scrubbing out the sink and the glitter ruined many of the paint brushes. Aside from the glitter, huge messes being left in the M yad has been a reoccurring issue and I would really appreciate for us to all do a bit better at keeping the space clean. Thanks :)
[2023-07-10, 6:45:49 PM] Gali Goldman: Hiiii! I believe I’m on shmira tonight but I’m currently sick. Is anyone available to switch with me?

- Read the seder yom - it will be printed in the techni office, and on white boards and will be sent in the group chat, know your responsibilities. If you can’t do something, tell me or Sadie ASAP.
- Be on time to things! With ruach! We are low on tzevet because of tiyul, we need all hands on deck!
- Mishpachot are by kvutzah today, it’s your job to split your kids into 2 groups and divide tzevet between and run “Rose, Bud, Thorn” with kibbud. Feel free if you have time to ask the kids how it makes them feel to be here for the 75th anniversary
SATURDAY:
- KIDS CAN’T SWIM AT TWIN!
- Saturday morning is looking a little different. It’s a separate seder yom, treat tomorrow like a special day, read it!!! There will be group and station leaders so know where you need to be
- if you have questions come talk to me
- you’re all killing it!!!!!
[2023-07-14, 5:07:53 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: July 14th Tzevet Asepha
Bring Shani your mirp ice packs!!! She’s out
People are pre-signed up for tafkidim for Shabbat - check the Seder yom!! + if you don’t like you tafkid, talk to Sadie or mairav
Mishpachot are happen by kvutzah today - split kids into 2 groups and do normal mishpachot things
Meet @ janusz for mishpachot
Tomorrow (Saturday) is going to run like a special day - tzevet needs to be ON!!!
Help keep the myad clean!! It is not solely on mira to clean up after. If you use things, deal with them! - if you actually can’t clean it up in the moment, give Mira a heads up so they know it’s there
Also, use the sign out sheet or let Mira know when you take things from myad!
Mira’s doing an order soon, let them know if there are things you need
Don’t make announcements in the chadar about things like “no more grilled cheese” just let kids know quietly at the tables if they hold up their trays

[2023-07-15, 6:17:52 PM] Gali Goldman: For what
[2023-07-15, 7:08:12 PM] ~ Sadie Quinn: Asepha notes July 15th:
- Yonni’s Iguana is coming on Thursday, stop by the M-Yad if you have time the next few nights so we don’t have to do all the kishutim on Wednesday night. There will also be a form asking about characters and costumes
- Help make the mo not gross! Pick up a dish or garbage every time you leave
- Thank you everyone for participating in the 75th Shabbat this morning
- You need to be up on time on Saturdays, that means you and your kids need to be around the binyan having had breakfast by 10:30
- Don’t put liquid in garbage bags and don’t let kids change the MYad garbage unsupervised
- Only clean water should go down gutters
- Shoutout to the tiyul specialists for a great tiyul!
- Where was tzevet at Shabbat shira and Rikkud? Please be there on time and with ruach! Be alert especially at transition times
- Tzofimot and Bonimot tzevet need to do their tiyul dishes
- Help the Madatz tzevet by sending Madatz to bed at 1am
- Madatz tzevet will send peula locations for when we get back
- If you’re not the one person staying with the Madatz, come to the mo for an amazing tzevet peula
- DO NOT go into the techni’s desks without permission
- P’kakim have mostly been good during avodah, please keep finding Ezra AND everyone let him know if you’ll be off for avodah so he can find a p’kak to cover
- If you need to switch toranut, decide amongst yourselves and tell Yonni. Send your kids 45 minutes before lunch and dinner (during Zman Sport and Chuggim)
- Return your MYad supplies and let Mira know if you ever make a mess, they would love to help but not on zero notice
- Prop the gender neutral upper bathroom open with a rock during showers (and don’t lose the sign!)
- Don’t promise your kids meds before bringing them to the mirp, also pre-screen them beforehand. The mirp closes at 10! Only bring kids during clinic hours! Return ice packs!
- if techni supplies are low, tell Ariella or fill out an order form
[2023-07-15, 7:17:02 PM] Edden: if you have the pish bowl or golda for your peula location tomorrow, would you be willing to switch with me for the ad gordon? because we have a method that requires us to be in the forest
[2023-07-15, 8:41:04 PM] Yvonne: Can anybody tell me when bonimot bash takeover is? Because I thought it was at Shira right before lunch

[2023-07-19, 2:39:50 AM] ~ Shelly Kositsky: Hi everyone, I’m sending this message from Scotty:

Hi Tzevet Gadol, Scotty here. I wanted this message to come from me directly, but unfortunately I was taken out of the tzevet group chat before I could send it. Please do not hold Shelly accountable for passing on this message.
 I’m writing mostly to pass on information about my firing, because I have heard Maz is unwilling to share details. I think it’s important that people aren’t kept in the dark about this situation, especially because of the precedent it sets for machaneh this year.
In summary, these were the reasons I was given for being fired:
The official, contract reason, was ‘repeated insubordination.’
The issues brought up, constituting insubordination, during the firing conversation were:
- The protest at the beginning of the summer, concerning the gender policy
- Speaking poorly of Mazkirut and Maz decisions, directly to them, with other tzevet members, and to chanichimot (when asked for examples of speaking with chanichimot specifically, the only provided was the Peula I ran that day addressing the slides protest)
- Taking up too much space on tzevet gadol, and within my tzevet katan
- Communicating poorly with my tzevet katan
- People felt pressured to agree with my opinions, and uncomfortable disagreeing with me
- Bullying members of tzevet (the only example provided for this was a time when Noga walked over while me and others were having a conversation about the feelings circle, we stopped joking around when she came over, and then she said “Well that was uncomfortable” and we laughed awkwardly)
- The Peula that I ran for my kids that day, concerning the slides protest, protesting in general, and youth agency

The only concrete examples provided for any of this behaviour, despite me asking four times for examples during the conversation, were the protest at the beginning of the summer, the pish about the slides protest, and the conversation Noga came up to. To the best of my recollection, this account should be quite neutral and accurate. (I recorded a voice memo that detailed what was said in the conversation only about an hour afterwards, which I am partially going off of here.) I don’t feel that all of what was said was accurate to my behaviour at camp, but that isn’t really the most important thing here. I also want to say that I was not provided with feedback or warnings about any of the things mentioned in the firing conversation at any point, excluding perhaps a conversation Noga and Ezra and I had about the pish specifically, a couple hours before I was fired.

Going off of this as (unfortunately delayed) feedback, if you have ever felt bullied by me, or like I took up too much space on tzevet, please reach out to me, I’d love to have a conversation with you and offer an apology! That was never my intention, and I was really surprised to hear that during the firing conversation. It deeply matters to me to be able to have good respectful conversations on tzevet, and create welcoming and inclusive space. That was the way I understood that I was behaving, and it’s important to me to hear outside perspectives if you feel that was not the case.
If you have any clarifying questions, or just want to discuss more in depth, please feel free to reach out to me also! My goal with this is to be as transparent as possible. I also encourage you all to have conversations with each other about your thoughts on this situation, which I am sure you are doing anyways.
 I miss all of you, and I’m really sad I wasn’t given the opportunity to say goodbye to the vast majority of you. I really hope that I’ll get to see you guys again and this isn’t our last encounter. <3
I’m also sending along the message that I sent to mazkirut just now, which outlines my thoughts about the situation a bit more in depth. Feel free to give it a read if you want.
All my love, uh!
Scotty
[2023-07-19, 2:40:24 AM] ~ Shelly Kositsky: Also:
To Mazkirut 2023–
First off, I want to make it abundantly clear that criticism about your leadership is not akin to bullying, nor is it a reflection of your individual worth. I hope that you read the following message with open minds. It is a long message, but in the name of dialogue I trust that you will read it anyways.
I stand by what I said behind closed doors, to other members of tzevet about your actions, and speaking my mind should not be a fireable offence.
Every conversation that I have had with any of you was in the name of generating dialogue and creating meaningful change at machaneh. No violent tactics were used, and no words were spoken to any of you about anything other than choices you had made in leadership positions. I took great care to speak clearly and calculatedly and without anger in my voice. However, time and time again, I was left feeling like what I said was received as an ego hit, an attack on you as individuals. As a leadership body in general, but particularly that of a supposedly radical youth movement, it is critical to be able to receive criticism without taking it personally, and reflect on the opinions shared rather than going on the defensive. The fact that you cited conversations I have had with various members of Mazkirut as a reason why you were firing me further enforces the idea that dialogue is not possible within this space.

Once again, there was a deep lack of care present in the way this situation was handled. No previous warnings were given. At no point did any of you make it clear to me that my actions were fireable. I was never given clear feedback, or even a strike, about any of the things that you listed in the firing conversation. How does this represent restorative justice? How does this reflect machaneh values? At what point was I allowed the opportunity to reconsider, to reflect about my actions and the supposed impact on tzevet gadol or mazkirut?
I was ushered out of camp immediately after the firing conversation, without the ability to say goodbye to the majority of tzevet, any of my chanhichimot, or machaneh as a space that I have called home for the past 12 years of my life. I urge you all to think about what you would have felt like in my position. I am deeply grieving.
Did anyone check to make sure I was going to be able to make it back to Vancouver that night? That there was a ferry for me to catch in Nanaimo? That I had a way to pay for myself to get back? Nobody checked in with me to make sure I had somewhere to sleep in Vancouver, nobody offered me dinner. Thank god my phone happened to be fully charged (a rare occurrence at machaneh), otherwise I would have been alone, with no information on ferry schedules, no way to contact someone about getting me home. This also goes for anyone else who is fired at machaneh. This should not be the operating protocol.

During the firing conversation, you said that this was for the good of chanichimot and machaneh, but from what I have heard from my tzevet and other individuals on tzevet gadol, many chanichimot are understandably distraught and confused. I would like all of you to reflect on how this has impacted them, and what positive effects there have been thus far. How have you cared for them in this situation? What support have you provided my tzevet in caring for them? Additionally– how did you think you were going to keep this under wraps? Are you so ashamed of your own decisions that you cannot admit to children that I was fired, you must obscure it as my own decision?
The same thing goes for tzevet: How has this had a good impact on tzevet culture, and tzevet gadol as individuals and as a collective? What message has this sent about the way that mazkirut will treat tzevet members? I guarantee you this will affect your relationship with the majority if not the entirety of tzevet gadol. And what about the extra weight that my tzevet now has to carry, and the upset kids they are left to deal with? Several of them have reached out to me expressing that they are deeply upset by this situation, and the impact it is having on them and the kids.
So many members of tzevet have reached out to me to express upset about this situation and their support over my actions. I know that many more have talked to others besides me about their upset. I hope they bring their concerns and thoughts to you as well. I believe this has a deeper impact than you are aware of.

Additionally, it is bizarre to me that this conversation has centred around my behaviour as an individual, rather than the structural and political issues within the Machaneh space that I am attempting to bring to light. If you are committed to creating machaneh as a radical space, there needs to be space for disagreement, and inquiry into how we can grow. Also, the complete condemnation of protesting within this space is absurd. Why are we, who sing Union Maid and Solidarity Forever and Banks of Marble and so many other songs, resistant to organizing within our own space? Why is it shut down immediately, rather than inquired into, rather than addressed? Why is it taken as a personal offence?
What you have done is send a strong message that anyone who speaks ill of the decisions made by mazkirut, and the environment at machaneh will be dismissed without warning. Is this the dialogue that you supposedly stand for? The reason why there is such division on tzevet, and a growing distrust of mazkirut is not the things me, or anyone else on tzevet is saying about your actions. It is the actions themselves.

The move to fire me goes against everything I thought Machaneh stood for: youth empowerment, collective action, restorative justice, inclusive space, education, dialogue, democracy… I am deeply disappointed in all of you, as representatives of machaneh and what we stand for, as a managing body, and above all, as my peers whom I have grown up with. I really hope that this message generates some reflection for you all.
With hope for a better future at Miriam,
Scotty

[2023-07-19, 5:57:36 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: July 19th asepha notes
 stop stealing candy from Ariella and Noga’s desk!!!
Yay for shira (both before and after lunch)!!!! Remember not to sing shira songs too fast so kids can learn and keep up!
Bring back ‘I want it that way’ when washing hands!!
Don’t let kids bang on mirp doors after hours. People are trying to sleep!
Talk to channies about not smearing poop on the toilet seats/bathroom walls
Bring ruach to mifkad in the morning!!
Don’t leave your tea bags in your mugs and give coffee and hot chocolate a rinsy rinse when you’re done!
Garbage will be taken care of soon! There were no garbage bags this morning :(
Yom israel is tomorrow! Come help out tonight for setup/kish tonight. Find maya and she’ll direct you where to go to help out
Painted on cardboard/paper cannot be recycled. Neither can construction paper. Don’t put it in the michzur.
If you are a character for yom israel tomorrow, find shai after the asepha to figure out costumes
Kids are hiding their GI sickness. Ask your kids if they’re having stomach problems
KIDS HAVE TO WASH THEIR HANDS!! Don’t share water bottles, but make sure kids are still drinking
We don’t do the “no more cornbread” announcements at meals. Just tell kids calmly that food is out by table (not solely about cornbread… this is about all foods)
Make sure kids are getting 1 piece of cornbread each
If your kids borrow stuff for tiyul, make sure they give them back to the person
Don’t breathe in the sharticles!!!!
Stop banging plates and bowls and kitchen things together during lunch shira
Come talk to Mairav about running chug Alef and/or bet
Pretend to be old and tired during anachnu madrichimot
Be with your children on yom israel… maya will poop in your bed if you’re not present
Tonight in movie night instead of tochnit erev. If you don’t want to have your kids there, let Sadie or rue know so that they don’t wait for you before playing the movie
In the madrichol Toran “rosh song” at lunch shira we say “prielle Prielle Prielle melafefon gadol” which means big cucumber

[2023-07-22, 6:44:55 PM] ~ eli gerut: hey folks! just wanted to remind ppl that many people who have had birthdays this session didn’t end up receiving their cake that we made for them. mitbach has a list of all bdays! if u have a birthday at camp we know about it and we WILL make you a cake (this is a threat). if you or anyone on your tzevet has a birthday coming up, come check in with anyone on mitbach on their birthday and we will retrieve their cake for you!
[2023-07-22, 7:12:14 PM] Yonnie: Hey does anyone know where the microphone is? I believe we used it for kishutim
[2023-07-22, 7:12:55 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: Twin asepha
Jackson’s proud of everybody (again). He loves you
Madatz are feeling like there’s too much weight on them to bring the ruach at camp. Tzevet step it up!!!
Don’t leave spray paint/exacto knives outside of the myad!!!! Put shit away
Be mindful of how we’re using spray paint. Don’t hotbox the air and wear a mask. And the door and windows of the myad should be close when spray painting
Also stop killing paint brushes!!! Wash them after use
You should not be leaving toranut in the middle of it. You need to be there for all of it
This Shabbat morning was awesome!!!
Send Mairav your funny kid things for triple M!!
Be on for havdallah!!!
Not enough tzevet were at the Shabbat asepha. You need to come to it!!
Madatz should not be alone with kids!
Cougar update: conservation officers are here to make sure camp is safe. They are making a plan with their team. We are buying whistles for every tzevet member, do not use them unless you actually see the cougar and DO NOT give them to channies
If you see a cougar, blow the whistle, get big, and yell. As soon as you can call Ezra (rosh cougar)
Until you hear otherwise we are still going with channies to the bathroom at night. In the day groups are still good.
You can fill empty pop cans with rocks to use as shakers to keep in the tzrif for walking at night (Purim came early)
If you are not on the shomrimot tzevet, it is not ok to pull shomrimot kids out of programming to have sichot with them. Their madrichimot are there to care for them. The kids need to be able to trust their tzevet. This goes for all channies. Direct kids to their tzevet
There needs to be tzevet members at tables during meals!! Check the chadar to see if tables need madrichimot at them
The last order goes out tomorrow!! Get your orders in by tonight if you want them in time for final mess (the order will come by tomorrow night)
Don’t forget final wills!!!
Don’t forget to take your kids birthday cake from the mitbach
Be present for shira and make sure kids are where they need to be during it (specifically shabbat shira)
KEEP THE SEVVY CLEAN!!!
We should not be acting like we’re just here for a job. Kids should think that we’re here cause we want to be there. Don’t talk to them at length about off blocks and fesh, they don’t need to know
If you hear a whistle blowing (cougar alert), don’t go running. There will be a cougar squad that will deal
If you notice that paper towels are empty, refill it! If you notice the garbage is full, stomp it!
We’ve been lacking rosh gadol!! If you see garbage, pick it up!! If you see wandering children, ask where they should be!
There cannot be dishes/food lying around machaneh. They are cougar food!!!
Big day is coming up. You should talk with your tzvatim and decide who’s doing it.
Keep the mo clean. When you leave, take a dish around

[2023-07-23, 6:13:48 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: July 23 asepha notes
Scrap paper bin in only for paper that can be used again (only has writing on one side of the page)
KEEP THE SEVVY CLEAN
Someone stole the “colouring” box from the myad shelves. Please return it, we need it. If you’re taking something from the myad, don’t take the whole box.
 If you use up supplies, tell Mira so they can order more
If you’re eating in the myad, clean up after yourself
Make accusations against kids for kangaroo court by tonight
Keep machaneh clean!! Don’t leave garbage or dishes around. Hold tzevet and kids accountable!! Make kids throw out yogurt cups and granola bar wrappers
Rosh gadol it up!!! Techni points ARE happening
You cannot drink your kupa beverages outside where kids can see you
Stop stealing shit from the technis desks
Yay ruach!!! Keep it up
We’re meeting at the bus at BB takeover at 3:45
Play up takeover for the Bonimot!! “Hell no we won’t go!!!” It up
Don’t leave your coffee and tea mugs on the tables in the chadar. They should go in the sevvy
Slow down when singing at shira so people can keep up and understand. Also tell kids to keep it slow too
Kupa is great and fun and sexy, but keep in mind that Yerbas at like $4 a can and they really cut into kupa when we’re buying a bunch. Use kupa responsibly
Final mess will happen where kids have designated places to be in (cougar and thunderstorm safety). Movies will be running in the chadar until sunrise. Kvutzot can claim designated spaces for organized activities
 Don’t misgender your channies (or anyone at machaneh). Correctly people kindly if they mess up
Put in your kupa percentages!!
 Cougar update: no cougar sightings since yesterday morning at 2:30am. If you see something, say something. We’re not cougar clear for the next week (unless we catch it before then). We’re still being careful, and especially at dusk. Cougars are most active during dusk and dawn
If you are madrichor Toran, wake up!! And you and gaga pit toran get to hang out in the morning Yayy
Tell your kids that we haven’t seen the cougar, but we’re still being careful and walking in pairs
You can explain the trap to your kids if they ask about it. Just say it’s there to humanely catch the cougar
Remind kids to walk in pairs. If you see someone walking alone, buddy up with them
Pay attention to make sure kids aren’t wandering off from group activities
If you need the bus, you need to let Ezra know at least 2 days in advance
If you are on medura superstar you need to be at the medura pit!! Kids cannot be there unsupervised
If you see people that you don’t recognize on camp property, approach them in pairs and then let either noga or Ezra know
Please be present, on, and with your kids when you are on. Count your kids!!!
If you have gear in your bags from tiyul, return it to the grofit

Shani is on call tonight! Let her sleep through the night!! If kids feel sick, send them to bed! Only wake Shani up if there is vomit, lots of blood, broken bones, extreme pain, or other actual emergencies. We want Shani to sleep yayyyy
The shmo is closed! A window broke last night. Also, just respect the shmo.
People’s devices have been going missing. Shits expensive. Stop taking peoples things. If you have noa’s computer charger please give it back
It’s time for t shirts and photos to be given to children. They’re in the bayit. Pick them up for your kids!
Be mindful of noise levels tonight. People are still going to be trying to sleep tonight, so be respectful
Please be nice to the madatz!!! Speak to them kindly
Please also be mindful about boundaries with madatz! No private sichot in secluded locations. Keep your mouth off the madatz, it’s not attractive!!!
If you have time to have private sichot with kids that aren’t your kids, you aren’t doing your job. Consider power dynamics within these convos, not ok!!
If you consume substances, you simply cannot be anywhere on machaneh other than the mo and the chofnof
All substances on fesh NEED to be put directly back into the lock box. They cannot live anywhere else on machaneh
If a tzevet member asks you to do a thing, just trust them and help them out
Be more careful about phones in front of kids! We’ve gotten too loosey-goosey
Big day meeting is today during dinner in the mo
Anything left in the grofit is getting thrown out. Don’t leave your stuff in there unless you want to lose it. The grofit isn’t a garbage room, don’t just dump your shit in there
Final mess doc is finished! Check it!! Also, set your alarms. You need to be awake for your final mess shift, people are depending on you

Refresher on mirp: pre-screen your kids! Ask what’s up with them. Have they drank water??? Make them drink water! Try to wait till clinic hours to bring them. Know WHY they want to go to the mirp and use your judgment about bringing them. Always go with your kids to the mirp. Remind your kids and yourself to take meds and drink water! Don’t leave your kids at the mirp unless the medics tell you you’re good
Mira has started an myad wish list for supplies! It’s in the myad above the sign out sheet! If you’ve finished something or want something, write it down and put it in the wish list bag so mira can get it!!! (Not including supplies for pish or tochnit erev, you have to get those yourself)
If you have little/new kids, explain to them what shmira is!!
Sadie is around to help you prep/run your peulot!!! Use her as a resource
Let riff raff put your kids to bed!! We miss them!!
Stop banging utensils in the chadar! Shit breaks and it’s expensive
Don’t go into the walk in!! There are problems with the fridge and we need to keep it cold! Unless the mitbach has given you explicit permission, don’t go in!
If you have a kid who is sick/crying in a corner/not where we think they should be, you need to let the people that are supposed to be with them know. This goes especially for things where kvutzot are split up!
Keep track of the nice laminated anaf signs. Make sure they get returned where they need to go
Keep the machzan clean and organized please! And don’t take things that are not explicitly for you!! Also check the machzan before ordering things, there might be things in there that you can take and don’t have to order
Tiyul is in 8 days!!! We’re doing things NOT last minute, plan shit for your kids!! Don’t just make it chill time the whole time, do fun things and activities with them! Make them excited about the outdoors! The tiyul specialist will ask you about your activities in your tiyul briefing! Be prepared
Be aware of your noise levels at night!!! Kids are in bed, be respectful!
You’re killing it, great job!! - Ezra
If you need help with ivrit, let gal know!! She’ll be in the techni office and is happy to help!
The Melavot are not your first line of defence for upset kids. It’s the madrichols job to check in with your kids and make sure they are ok. We should not be accounting for every sad kid. Tzevet should support and be there for them! Supporti if sad kids is an incredible way to bond with your children! If it’s really intense we are there to help, but tzevet should be there first. If you want to talk through how to support sad kids with us for a refresher, please do!! We’d be happy to talk with you about strategies.
We’re blowing through kupa a little too fast. Consider the difference between need vs want and also just use discretion. Try to slow down with how much you order at a time. Also, nicotine is expensive and is eating up a lot of our kupa. India has proposals to mitigate this: 1) buying loose Tobacco and rolling our own 2) buying 1-2 reusable vapes and getting pods to share between us. Let them know what you think! If you have questions, feel free to talk to India about it
We can order some food and drinks through Sysco! Write on the order form to order through the mitbach and Ariella can facilitate that
There have been fuck ups with substances being in places that they CANT be around machaneh and also feshed people being in places that they CANT be around machaneh. That is incredibly not ok and simply can’t happen. We need to all take responsibility in making sure that things annd people are hidden and not anywhere where kids are. Substances are a privilege that can be taken away if these fuck ups keep happening

[2023-07-31, 8:57:36 PM] ~ Maisie: One of the major downsides of the kids being back is that you have to check before you sit on any toilet because there’s a 70% chance that a channie didn’t aim and pissed all over the seat.

 tomorrow in yo momma!! Help the datz with kish tonight!!!
Please charge speakers in the techni office when you’re done using them!! People need them
We need 1 person to help with Amelimot bedtime! Talk to Alias
Things with paint on it cannot be michzur-ed. Consider the things you put in the michzur, kids see it
The health inspector is coming tomorrow! We REALLY need things to be kept clean, especially washrooms and the mitbach. If you don’t have to be in the mitbach, don’t go in tomorrow. The sevvy might be closed tonight, if it’s not, keep it insanely clean
Remind kids to be respectful and careful while entering the chadar
Enforcing a “eat eat go go!” Atmosphere isn’t constructive and can be super stressful for kids. Just be mindful that food can be hard for kids and be respectful about that
If you’re at a table and see a kids refusing to eat, let their tzevet know so they can keep track of it
Bring Ezra the avodah signs!! If you lost yours, make a new one
You need to make sure your kids are doing their anaf jobs! Check up on the kids and make sure it’s happening

 Tzevet needs to be at the last rikkud song where we run in groups and then go through machaneh. Keep the tradition alive! Do it with your kids!!
There are a lot of new kids here this session! Explain things to your kids so that traditions don’t die
Tiyul prep is starting!! Come help in the mitbach with prepping food!! The tiyul specialists need people! Please be respectful of the work that the tiyul specialists are doing in the mitbach. Don’t just be in the mitbach to mess around and get in the way
Talk to your kids about tiyul! Make sure they have the things that they need and if not start looking.
Start paying attention to which kids shouldn’t be going on tiyul
During chug Alef and bet tzevet should be at the madregoat and count your kids!! Even if you aren’t running one you should help get them started
When sitting in camp-wide activities (eg. the oneg), sit with your kids!!! Don’t just clump in the back with tzevet
If you want to play live music for havdallah, talk to mairav
Tzevet needs to be on for havdallah!!! Help make sure it’s a good experience for everyone. Explain to kids that they need to be quiet and respectful during it
If you still haven’t gotten your angel/devil, find Gali and get them!!
MWOPs… what does it mean??? You are NEVER without a purpose. Your job is to keep your eyes peeled and watch out for bad behaviour and do something about it. Being on means being present and participating and watching for things
Sexism is prevalent among tzevet. Watch out for it, recognize it, change the culture of you notice it. We want a safe and kind tzevet community both for us and for our chanichimot. There will be further sichot about this. If you have additional feedback about this issue, talk to maz so they can gain a further understanding.
If you see things that should be in the shmo, bring them back to the shmo
Talk to your kids about respectful actions and words at camp. In general swearing between kids and tzevet should be shut down. If you see vulgar graffiti in the bathroom, write over it (avodah)
Please return car keys if you use them. Ariella needs the keys back as soon as you’re done using the cars
The next order is going out Monday. Fill out your forms by Sunday night
Please make sure to get proper receipts if you need to be reimbursed
Hydrate!!! Make sure you and your kids are drinking enough water!!
There’s been a lot of foot issues… make sure your dogs are getting aired out, that people are changing socks, and that people are cleaning their feet in the shower
Make sure your kids are taking their meds during med hours!!

It has been such a blast being back at machaneh!! Just remember kids don’t know when things go wrong, kids feed off of your energy, and remember you come to camp to not only have dugma and hadricha but to have fun!!! Camp is only magical when you help make the magic happen! Help a chanichol with a Medura/musical act, start kvutza jokes, hype people up!!! Remember what you loved the most about madrichimot when you were a kid and channel that energy! It’s okay to be silly, goofy, and weird (no such thing as normal #duh)! That’s what makes camp so special!! EGE energy generates energy! Start a catch phrase! Start a trend! Start some handshake with each other! When kids see you having fun they want in!! I hope everyone rocks the rest of the session! And most importantly don’t forget to SLAY!!!!!! ❤️

[2023-08-06, 6:12:55 PM] ~ Talia Joffe: August 6th tzevet asepha
We need to slow down when singing rad hayom. It’s too fast
Stop kids from singing verses of songs earlier/later than the rest of camp. Encourage everyone to sing in unison
Tiyul is coming up! If you’re worried about your kids on hiking tiyuls, talk to tal about it so he can assess. This needs to happen today! Also let Noga know!!
If you need Tiyul gear, talk to tal too, he’s starting a tiyul gear spreadsheet. This needs to happen today
Be on your kids about getting their meds! Don’t make tal track them down!
The Bonimot are not running ivrit today, which means you need to plan it for your kids. They’re running the kululam tomorrow!
Chanichimot should not leave tables without checking with the tzevet member at the head of the table. Know where your kids are! Check with them when they get up from the table, ask where they’re going
Keep track of the kids on toranut if you’re with them that day!
If you’re toran, you need to help with the sevvy dishes!! It gets gross quick, just do them
Please keep the storage room in the mains organized. Don’t leave it a mess
Help Jane find her sunglasses! They say “riders” on the side
Don’t leave dishes in the mo or around machaneh. If you see them, bring them to the mitbach to be washed! Do not leave your coffee and tea mugs at the tables for kids on toranut to clean up. They go back to the sevvy to be washed
Don’t bring drinks around machaneh as your go through the day. You can have tea and coffee in the chadar, but not around machaneh
Kids are not allowed to pull pranks alone. Their madrichimot need to be there with them to supervise
In the song “not fade away” during lunch shira, we’ve re-added 2 new sentences. They are: “I really like Israeli girls, with dark brown hair and deep brown curls. She’s so gorgeous I am dying, all I wanna do is fly to Zion.” And “I really like Israeli guys, with dark brown hair and deep brown eyes. He’s so gorgeous I am dying, all I wanna do is fly to Zion” let’s bring them back!
Put garbage in the garbage bins!! Don’t just pile it in front of the bins!
If you’re throwing out something sharp, wrap it in paper and tape and label what it is. So if you have broken glass, wrap it in paper and tape and label it “broken glass”
Be outside the chadar before meals and sing the cheers! Let’s teach the kids the songs and make sure that tradition doesn’t die
There only needs to be one tzevet member per table before kids are in the chadar. Other than the people inside, everyone else should be outside singing
After mifkad every day we sing songs as leave. I’m the morning it’s the la avodah song, in the evening it’s the Sherutim one. Let’s bring them back!!!
If we don’t continue these traditions every year, they will cease to exist. It is up to us to keep them alive! Interact with your kids during it too so they learn!
The last order before tiyul closes at 10:30 tonight. Get your orders in before then!
Tell Ariella where your chug is meeting so she can direct kids on where to go. Also pick up your chug kid list at the techni

[2023-08-11, 2:30:41 PM] Shai Rubin: Important PSA: During rikkud, please do NOT play soccer or gaga ball with kids. They should be doing rikkud. Early night soccer is not a thing. It should not become a thing. The only option at that time is rikkud.
[2023-08-11, 2:31:32 PM] Shai Rubin: That also means you should be doing rikkud if you don’t have another tafkid. Unless you have other obligations, your only option at that time is rikkud.

[2023-08-11, 2:33:11 PM] ~ Sadie Quinn: Extra reminders for Shabbat:
- Be at all machaneh wide activities if you don’t have another tafkid! That means shira, rikkud, musicale, havdallah, medura!

 the mountain lion (cougar) has become a lot more active, which means we’re WAY more vigilant. This means that sayarimot and chotrimot need to wake a madrichol up at night to go to the bathroom, shomrimot and up need to take a buddy. Tzevet is not allowed to walk alone at night. As soon as the sun sets, we’re being hyper vigilant.
We need more tzevet outside and singing before the chadar doors open for lunch and dinner
Refill the toilet paper when doing sherutim. Just refill it, we need it
Reminder to Rosh gadol. Put stuff back and if you see something, deal with it
Bonimot are doing ivrit today
BB takeover is at kibbud tomorrow
Tell Ariella where your chug is meeting before chuggim starts. There are kid lists on her desk
We’re nearing the end of the session. There’s a couple more drives left. If you want to order things for your final mess, you should start now

I know there’s about 10 of you with beaners from the grofit, so it is time you find a new solution to trying to look like a cool outdoorsy BC person. We appreciate your cooperation,
Warmest regards,
The tiyul specialists.

If you are leaving for decon and have already told a maz member, text a member of maz to remind them of this. If you have not told them, tell them now
Put garbage bags in the bins. Don’t overflow the garbage bins. Just try to keep that area clean
Be a part of lunch shira. Don’t talk in clumps of tzevet, have fun and sing with the kids
Be respectful of fesh supplies and try not to use them up super fast
Food and other things are being left in the mo overnight… ew, please don’t do that. Clean it up and put it away. You can even use the sink in the mo to wash out your dishes
Don’t let your avodah kids come hang with tzvia when they’re don’t avodah. Tzvia also has work to do and they distract them
If your garbage bin needs to be changed, let Yvonne know so she can deal with it
If you have watches or Fanny packs that you’re willing to pass off to Bonimot or tzofimot, offer them up

We are critically low on specifically cups, forks, and pitchers. Please return them if/when you use them. It’s not good that we’re so low
Get Leya in the chadar so we can zombie her
If you see a tzevet member with an upset kid, don’t flock to them. It’s overwhelming when there’s too many people around. You can give a little thumbs up to make sure the tzevet member is doing good, and then move on.
If there’s a bathroom that’s in rough shape, rosh gadol that shit. Clean it!!! If you don’t have time to clean it, tell someone else and see if they can clean it
Yom meyuchad briefing is at 11pm (can change). As soon as you’re done with bedtime come to the briefing and help with kish. If you’re a character check in with Mira about costumes
The grofit is closed off to chanichimot. It is a privileged space. Do not let them in there unless they have permission from ilana, Ollie, or Ezra. If you find a kid in there, get them out and tell them not to go in there again
Tonight is sodo final mess. They’ll be around the point/platform/slab. Also give them a nice little nudge to come back next year!
Give yourself time to write final wills for your kids!
Big day is coming up. Talk to your tzevet about who’s doing kid drop off and let Ezra know by end of day tomorrow who’s going.
We need 2 volunteers to drive the uhaul

[2023-08-21, 2:38:17 AM] Tyler: Hello everyone, specifically those involved with planning and actualizing the “prank” that took place tonight. I am writing this because I am deeply upset and honestly in shock at the lack of empathy and concern for the well being of those effected by this. I understand that the thought of this may have seemed humorous while planning however I urge you to reflect on how negatively this has impacted multiple people (myself included.) weren’t you the ones who were read the rules about pranks for multiple summers of your lives growing up here? No harmful pranks. I apologize for being up front about this but I was panicking for the past multiple minutes of my life. Please put yourself in my shoes for a minute. The group that I was apart of was tasked to search the chof. We were all yelling and running in the dark with crazy fucking waves, we all had to come to terms the idea that these kids went in and possibly drowned. That’s not someing that people should be forced to think about for no good reason. When over the walkie y’all said to meet, and then at the meeting said nothing about them being found. Of couse Im going to assume the worst. I hate being a party pooper but this was not ok.
[2023-08-21, 2:42:06 AM] Dan: Is there a confession link form or how this is working

This will be a space to think together about our movement partners, fellow tzevet members, family, and friends that are in Israel right now. This event is unaffiliated with local organizations and is being held by and for the Israeli and Jewish communities in Vancouver. I will personally be wearing a chultza and would love to see other members of my community there. Here’s the link for more information: https://facebook.com/events/s/vigil-for-israel/660304452901185/?mibextid=RQdjqZ

[2023-10-27, 1:10:27 PM] ~ Rachel Oppenheimer: Did anyone meet at the end of the summer to talk about who would be running the vic ken? Everyone has moved around this year so idk who is here and  willing to do it. If there wasn’t a convo at machaneh we should make a group chat for vic and meet up at some point to discuss. Unless people have already organized something it’s definitely too late for a halloween event this year imo.
[2023-10-27, 1:22:25 PM] Dan: No one has talked to me. Are we doing anything?
[2023-10-27, 1:22:32 PM] Dan: We should make a gc

[2023-12-06, 9:00:55 PM] ~ Ariella Smith-Eidelman: Hi everyone  :)

TLDR: We wanna do a day-long tzevet seminar in Vancouver over winter break. Let us know if you wanna come and what dates work for u.

We hope you’re surviving finals and getting excited for some much needed rest & relaxation. Myself and the ken mazkirut have been thinking about putting together a 1 day (or half day) lil seminar to bring the Miriam tzevet in Vancouver together while many of you are home from school. I’m sure these past couple months have been difficult, and we want to create an opportunity to both come together and share how we’re feeling and what we’re thinking, and also just to have some silly fun times and celebrate being together.

We’re gonna send a poll to try to find a date that works best for most people, so please vote for every day that you can make it, not just the one that you’d like the most 🤩🌼🐮🍄

[2024-01-18, 6:40:53 PM] Ron: Hey guys probably a little late but if you are posting about the situation (no matter your politics or “side”) you should really remove Chanechim from your stories because a couple of them have been VERY confused about certain posts (asking me and some other tzevet about it) and what’s most important is them not feeling the division among tzevet or community in general. I blocked chanechim from my story from the beginning because I didn’t want my strong opinions to influence them and I really think we should’ve all done that from the start (Especially if they are israeli or have israeli family). So much loves ✨💖💖💖
[2024-01-18, 6:41:53 PM] ~ Nicole: Thank you so much for saying this Ron 💙💙
[2024-01-18, 6:46:05 PM] Ron: Luvs u💙
